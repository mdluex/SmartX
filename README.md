# SmartX Open Source Project
Put any word after smart â€¦ it will be (smart home, smart company, smart factory, etc.)  Here is how we get the idea to make a one device that can control deferent places without any extra components. 

# How SmartX Works?
SmartX is a open source platform based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3, with a android application that allows you to control or monitor your place remotely. 

# SmartX Device
Because we want to make a one device, we made a simple case that protect the inside components and implements all the microcontrollers devices with a monitoring LCD to check the status. 

# SmartX Mobile App
To make things easier we made a mobile application that allows you to control your place or apartment remotely.
